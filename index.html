    Hi! My name is Rachel and this is one of my first courses I'm taking for the Journalism + Design major! I'm really interested in the Journalsim + design major and so far this class has been pretty cool. I'm not completely sure how to do coding I've only done pretty small coding before this but I'm excited to learn! Check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachellpotter/">instagram</a> :p
