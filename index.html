    <h2>A Bit About Me:</h2>
    	<p>
    		Hey! I'm Rachel and I'm originally from Baltimore, Maryland. I'm currently going to school in NYC so I've been living there since August, 2020. I like to paint funky things and make cool collages. Currently I'm really digging like techno-ish(?) music; my go to is machine girl and death grips. Below is one of my pieces of art I did about two months ago, it reminds me of a face, hope you like it (or don't it's your opinion).
